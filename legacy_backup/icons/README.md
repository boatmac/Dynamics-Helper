Dynamics Helper Extension Icons

This folder contains the icon assets used by the extension. The manifest will reference PNGs at the following sizes:
- 16x16: icons/16.png
- 32x32: icons/32.png
- 48x48: icons/48.png
- 128x128: icons/128.png

Development placeholders:
- You can use simple placeholders for initial testing. Recommended: a solid background with the letters "DH".
- Replace the placeholder files with your branded assets when ready.

Design guidelines (Chromium/Edge):
- Format: PNG
- Background: opaque (avoid transparency for store listing clarity)
- Maintain legibility at small sizes (16/32)
- Keep padding and avoid edge-to-edge graphics

If you regenerate assets manually:
- Ensure exact pixel sizes as listed above.
- Keep filenames consistent with the manifest references.
